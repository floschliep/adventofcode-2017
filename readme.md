## What's this?
This repo contains my solutions for 2017's [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) challenges.

## Optimization
All these solutions are my first approach and not optimized in any way. I might come back to some of them later and improve their performance.

## Format
Every challenge is an independent Xcode Playground. My respective puzzle input is inside each playground's `Resources` folder.
